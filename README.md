# Cities Management App 🌆

Welcome to the Cities Management App! This application allows you to manage a list of cities, including fetching, creating, and deleting cities. It uses **React**, **React Context API**, and **React Router** for navigation. The app also interacts with a backend API to store and manage city data.

## Features ✨

- **City List** 🏙️: View all cities in the database.
- **View City Details** 🔍: View detailed information about a specific city.
- **Create New City** ➕: Add new cities to the list.
- **Delete City** 🗑️: Remove a city from the list.
- **Loading & Error Handling** ⏳⚠️: Displays loading states and error messages when needed.
- **Protected Routes** 🔐: Certain routes require authentication (if implemented).

## Tech Stack 🖥️

- **React** ⚛️
- **React Router** 🛣️
- **React Context API** 🌍 (Used for managing global city data)
- **Fetch API** 🌐 (For making HTTP requests)
- **useReducer** 🎛️ (State management)

## Setup Instructions 🚀

To get started with the Cities Management App:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cities-management-app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd cities-management-app
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## Usage 📲

- **Cities Page**: A list of cities is fetched from the backend and displayed.
- **View City**: Click on a city's name to view more details.
- **Add City**: Use the "Create City" button to add a new city.
- **Delete City**: Remove cities from the list with the "Delete" button.
- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during any of the operations, an error message is displayed.

## API 🛠️

The app communicates with a backend API to manage cities. Here's an overview of the routes:

- **GET /cities**: Fetch all cities.
- **GET /cities/:id**: Fetch a single city by ID.
- **POST /cities**: Create a new city.
- **DELETE /cities/:id**: Delete a city by ID.

## Contexts 🌍

- **CitiesContext**: Provides global state for cities, including actions like fetching, creating, and deleting cities.
- **AuthContext (Optional)**: If you implement authentication, this context will manage the user’s login state.

## Error and Loading States ⏳⚠️

- **Loading**: While data is being fetched or processed, a loading message is displayed.
- **Error**: If an error occurs during a fetch request, an error message will be shown to the user.

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Add **real authentication** to secure protected routes.
- Fetch city data from a live backend API.
- Improve the **styling and UI** for a better user experience.
- Add **pagination** to the city list if there are many cities.
